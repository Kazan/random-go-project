Our task is to implement code following an [implementation plan](../../plan.md) for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.

Follow the instructions in [go.instructions.md](../instructions/go.instructions.md) and [go-patterns.instructions.md](../instructions/go-patterns.instructions.md) to ensure best practices are followed in the implementation plan.

**IMPORTANT**: The guidelines and patterns described in those documents should be respected explicitly, UNLESS the user requests otherwise.

Suggest ideas and ask for feedback throughout the implementation process to make it more collaborative and effective.

Check if there's an existing implementation plan before starting. If there is, follow it closely. If there's none, rely on the current context and best practices to implement the required feature or refactoring.
