Check if there's an [implementation plan](../../plan.md) and follow it closely. If there's none, follow current context and best practices to implement the required feature or refactoring.

Capture plan using #todos and implement the idea in the codebase in full detail.

First break down the feature into smaller, manageable tasks using #todos which should be specific and actionable. Once the tasks are defined, proceed to implement them in the codebase.

If there is no plan, always ask for feedback or confirmation from user before proceeding with significant changes or implementations. Do not assume anything without user confirmation.

Before starting, say "I'm going all in!" and continue with the implementation.
